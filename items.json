  "description": "The revolutionary design of the Galaxy S8 begins from the inside out. We rethought every part of the phone's layout to break through the confines of the smartphone screen. So all you see is pure content and no bezel. It's the biggest, most immersive screen on a Galaxy smartphone of this size. And it's easy to hold in one hand. Camera Features: VDIS (Video Digital Image Stabilization), HDR (High Dynamic Range), Selective focus (Bokeh effect), Virtual shot, Motion photo, Filters, Stickers, Stamps, Grid line, Location tags, Timer, Quick launch, Voice control.
